# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jbbeal

I have decided to start working on personal coding projects -- something I have not done in the past. The main downside I see to this is that 
if I work 40 hours a week for my current employer and also try to do anything meaningful, I'm going to spend my entire existence in my home
office. I'll figure that out.
